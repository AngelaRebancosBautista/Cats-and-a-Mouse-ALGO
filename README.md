# Cats-and-a-Mouse-ALGO

/This program determines which cat will reach the mouse first based on their positions. It calculates the distance of each cat to the mouse and returns `"Cat A"` if the first cat is closer, `"Cat B"` if the second cat is closer, or `"Mouse C"` if both cats reach the mouse at the same time.
